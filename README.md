Machine learning playground
===========================

Playing around with data.

This is where I will document my journey into machine learning.
I will share usefull resources and code examples.

The demos are for the most part in R, Python, C#, C++ and javascript.

I use frameworks such as:
https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs
https://github.com/harthur/brain
OpenCV

* Check out the [code examples](/Code examples/README.md)
* Want to play around? Check out some of the [datasets](/Datasets/README.md)
* Read more about resources for getting into machine learning [here](/Usefull resources/README.md
