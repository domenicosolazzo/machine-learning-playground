Machine learning playground
===========================

Playing around with data.

This is where I will document my journey into machine learning.
I will share usefull resources and code examples.

The demos are for the most part in R, Python, C#, C++ and javascript.

I use frameworks such as:

https://github.com/harthur/brain
OpenCV
