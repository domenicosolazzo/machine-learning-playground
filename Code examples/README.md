# Code examples

Machine learning can be split up into multiple fields ranging from understanding text, classifying spam and comming up with suggestions etc.
Dig deeper to read more about the different types of problems, and read trough the code examples.

## Computer vision
One of the hardest problems in machine learning of today is understanding image and sound.

## Classification, clustering
Every day there are sent roughly 183 billion spam messages. How can machines help us sweep trough this insane amount of content to let us communicate efficiently?
